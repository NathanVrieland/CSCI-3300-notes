# reliability 
- techniques for reliability inprovment
    - fault avoidence 
        - avoid introducing faults into the program
    - input validation
        - validate that all inputs conform to expected format
    - failure measurement
        - ensure program failures have minimal impact on users 

- complexity reduction
    - structural complexity 
        - how hard it is to understand the program
        - functions should do one thing only
        - no side effects
        - classes have single responsibility
        - minimize enheritance trees 
        - avoid multiple inheritance 
        - avoid threads unless necessary 
    - data complexity 
        - representations of daa and relationships between elements
        - define interfaces for all abstractions 
        - define abstract data types
        - avoid float types
        - never use data aliases 
    - decision complexity **not on final** 
        - complexity in the decisions of the program 
        - avoid deeply nested conditionals 
        - avoid complex conditionals

# refactoring
- changes and additions increase complexity 
- refactoring
    - chaning a program to reduce complexity 
    - doesnt change behavior
    - reduces reading complexity 
    - makes the program more understandable 
    - makes it easier to change 
    - redcues chance of making mistakes when you introduce new features

# code smells 
- idicators in the code that there might be a deeper problem 
- type and fixes
    - large classes 
        - break them down
    - long methods 
        - split into smaller fucntions
    - duplicated code
        - make into functions
    - meaningless names 
        - refactor into better names 
    - unused code 
        - delete it (you can always get it back from git)

# input validation 
- checking that 
    - users input is in the correct format 
    - input value is within range 
- critical for security and reliability 
- define rules for every type of input field 
    - if input does not pass, reject the input
- methods 
    - built in validation functions
        - lots of frameworks have stuff like isEmail() isInt() isDate() and stuff like that
    - type coercion 
        - stuff like int() in python
    - explicit comparisons
        - check against all possible values or range
    - regular expressions
        - powerful syntax for defining inputs

# failure minimization
- persistant data should not be lost or corrupted
- user should be able to reciver work done before failure
- software should not hang or crash 
- always 'fail secure' so that confidential data is not left in an unsecure state
