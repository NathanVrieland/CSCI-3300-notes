# software products
- three factors drive software design
    - buisness and consumer needs
    - dissatisfaction with existing sofware
    - changes in technology 
- create a list of features 
- personas, scenarios and user stories lead to features 

## persona aspects
- personalization 
    - name
    - personal cirumstance 
- job related 
    - what their job involves
- education
- relevance 
    - why they might be interested in the product 

## scenario
- arrative of how users might use the system
- dont include everything
- written from user's perspective
- does not iclude implimentation info
- scenario elements
    - statment of objective
    - reference to personas
    - info about what is involved in doing the activity 
    - explanaion of problems can cat currently be done with the current system
    - description of one way the identified problem might be addresed 
- are high level sories and not detail oriented 

## user stories
- written by users
- more fine grain 
    - as a (role)
    - I want (feature)
    - eso that I can (benefit)
- important for planning
- if the story is a more complex feature it might take several sprints to implement
    - this is called an epic 

## features
- should be 
    - independent
        - should not depend on how other features are implemented 
    - coherent 
        - should be linked to a single item of functionality and not do multiple things or have side effects
    - relevent
        - should reflect the way that users carry out tasks
- knowledge required
    - user knowledge 
        - knowing the user stories and scenarios
    - product knowledge
        - experiance with existing products 
    - domain knowledge 
        - knowlege of the work area the product aims to support 
    - tech knowlege 
        - knowing the tech required to implement it
- trade offs
    - simplicity vs functionality
    - familiarity vs novelty 
        - old vs new
    - automation vs control 

## feature creep
- occurs when new features are added in response to user requests without considering whether or not they are useful 
- too many features -> hard to understand 
- reasons
    - managers reluctant to say no
    - devs trying to match features in other products
    - product tries to appeal to experiance and inexperianced users 
- avoid feature creep with questions
    -  does the feature add anything new 
    - can this feature be implemented by extending existing features 
    - does this feature provide general fuctionality 
    - is this feature important 

## feature identification
- scenarios and user stories should always be the starting point for identifying product features 
- they are tools for thinking 
- user reaserch on its own rarely helps you innovate and invent to ways of working 
- you sould also think creativley about alteritive features
