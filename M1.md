# Software Development Approach
- Phases 
    - Requirments 
    - Design
    - Implimentation
    - Validation
    - Maintenence 

## Waterfall / sequential Approack 
- move through phases in a linear sequence 
    - no backtracking 
    - well understood
- limitations
    - limited applicability 
    - does not deliver a useful system until end
    - difficult to assess progress
    - difficult to correct errors
- high failure rate 
## rapid prototyping 
- approach 
    - develop portion of software
    - evaluate 
    - recieve feedback
    - repeat until satisfactory
- benifits
    - promotes communication
    - requirements more clear
    - demonstrates techincal feasibility 
- drawbacks
    - just demonstrations 
    - difficult to discard code
## iterative approach
