# Software Development Approach
- Phases 
    - Requirments 
    - Design
    - Implimentation
    - Validation
    - Maintenence 

## Waterfall / sequential Approack 
- move through phases in a linear sequence 
    - no backtracking 
    - well understood
- limitations
    - limited applicability 
    - does not deliver a useful system until end
    - difficult to assess progress
    - difficult to correct errors
- high failure rate 
## rapid prototyping 
- approach 
    - develop portion of software
    - evaluate 
    - recieve feedback
    - repeat until satisfactory
- benifits
    - promotes communication
    - requirements more clear
    - demonstrates techincal feasibility 
- drawbacks
    - just demonstrations 
    - difficult to discard code
## iterative approach 
- number of iterations
    - 2-6 weeks 
    - must balence iteration duration
- iteration scope
    - couple of use cases
    - must have return value 
    - deliver executable code
- risk-aware
- evolutionary
- adaptive 

# project based software engineering
- starting point: set of requirments
- developed by software company for client company
- customer may change requirements 
- usualy has long lifetime 

# product based software engineering 
- starting point: buisness opportunity 
- made by a company directly for end-users
- the software company is respocible for requirements and timescale
- reapod delivery ofo software products 

# software execution models
- stand alone 
    - code executes entirely on customer's machine 
- hybrid
    - part on customers machine, part on server
- software service 
    - all features implemented serverside 
    - browser or mobile app

# product vision 
- three questions 
    - what is the prduct?
    - who is it for?
    - why shoud people buy?

## Moore's vision template 
- FOR (customer)
- WhO (needs software for X)
- THE (product name) is a (catagory)
- THAT (benifit, stand out feature)
- UNLIKE (competitor)
- OUR PRODUCT (primary differentiation)
