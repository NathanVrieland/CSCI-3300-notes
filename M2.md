# Agile Software Engineering

## The agile manifesto 
- individuals and interactions over processes and tools;
- working software over comprehensive documentation;
- customer collaboration over contract negotiation;
- responding to change over following a plan.

## agile development principles
- involve the customer
- embrace change 
- develop and deliver incrementally
- maintain simplicity 
- focus on people, not the developmental process

# extreme programming (xp)
- the most influential work that has changed software development 
- coined by Kent Beck

## Extreme Programming practices 
- Incremental planning
- continuous integration
- test-first development 
- refactoring 
- small releases
- simple design 
- on-site customer
- sustainable pace 
- fair programming
- collective ownership

# Scrum
- agile methodthat provides framework for agile project organisation

## scrum terms
- Product 
- Product owner 
    - team member responsible for identifiing features, reviewing work, and testing
- product backlog
    - to-do list
- development team
- sprint
    - short period where product increment is developed 
- scrum
    - daily team meeting
- scrum master
    - team coach 
- Potentially shippabe product increment
- velocity 
    - estemate of how much can be done in a sprint

## product backlog 
- set of user stories 
    - as a (role)
    - I want (feature)
    - eso that I can (benefit)
- states
    - ready for consideration 
    - ready for refinment 
    - ready for implementation 
- product backlog items go from PB and refined into revised PB
- estimation metrics 
    - effort required
        - in person-hours
    - story points 

## sprints
- timboxed
    - work ends when time is up no matter if it is done or not
- activities 
    - planning
        - decide what needs to be done
    - execution
    - reviewing
- agile activities
    - tests should be automated 
    - whenever changes are made, they should be immidiatley integrated into the system
- code completness checklist
    - reviewed
    - unit tested
    - integrated 
    - integration tested
    - accepted

## teams
- ideal size: 5-8 people 
- advatage is that it can be cohesive team that can adapt 

# key points
- the best way to develop software is to use agile software engineering methods
- agile methods are based around iterative developent adn the minimization fo overheads 
- extreme programming is an influential agile method that introduced user stories, test first development, and continous integration, these are now mainstream
- scrum is an agile method that focuses on agile planning and managment, and it does not define engineering practices to be used 
- in scrum, work is organised into a product backlog 
- sprints are fixed time actvities, increments should be potentially shippable 
- a self organising tea is a development team that organises the work to be done by discussion and agreement 
- scrum practices (backlog, sprints, self organising teams) may be used in other agile development processes
