# this is focused around the example  questions
# types of testing
- Functional testing 
    - test the finctionality of the overall system 
    - discover as many bugs as possible 
    - povide convincing evidence tha the system is fit for its intended putpose 
- user testing 
    - test that the software product is useful and usable by end users
    - show that users understand how to access the software's features and use them
- preformacne and load testing 
    - test that the software works quickly and can handle the expected load placed on the system
- Security testing
    - t est that the software maintains its integrity and can protect user information from theft and damage 

# system testing
- code units are integrated into a working (maybe incomplete) version of the system
- checks that there is no unexpected interation betweenfeatures of the system
- may involve checking for 
    - responsivness
    - reliability
    - security
- dedicated testing team may be responsible for system testing
- for goals **example question**
    - discover if there are unexpeced and unwanted interactions between the features of a system 
    - discover if the tthe system features work together effectivley 
    - make sure it operates int he expected way in the different enviorments it will be used in 
    - test responsivness, througput, security, and other quality attributes 
# test driven development 
- good for units, hard to impliment for entire system 
- steps **example question**
    - identify partial implementaion
    - write mini unit tests
    - write a code stub that will fail tests
    - run all automated tests 
    - impliment code that will cause the failing tests to pass
    - rerun tests
    - refactor code if required 

# exhaustive vs selective testing
- in the example program, with 2 loops and 3 conditions, there were 10^14 possible paths
- exhaustive testing is impossible it would take 3170 years
- selective testing
    - test the most used and most important paths of a program \

# who should test the program 
- developer 
    - understands the system and overlooks issues 
- independent tester
    - must learn about the system and will attmpt to break it 
- independent tester  should test a system for best results

# white vs black box testing 
- white box
    - knowing the internal workings of a program, tests can be conducted to assure that the internal operation preforms according to spec
    - tests based on internal structure 
- functional (black box) testing 
    - Knowing the specified functions that a procuct has been designed to preform 
    - demonstrate it is fully operational
    - based on external behavior as well as internal structure
