# Architectural design
- system structuring 
    - architectural views
    - architectural patterns
- control modeling
- modular decomposition
- what is it?
    - the design process for identifying the subsystems making up a system and the framework for sub system control
- abstraction
    - in the small
        - individual programs
    - in the large 
        - complex systems
- advantages 
    - stakeholder communication
    - system analysis
    - large scale reuse 

## architectural representations 
- simple informal block diagrams
- detailed system model 
    - UML diagrams
- choices depend on the usage of models

## impact of design
- performance 
- security 
- safety
- avaliability 
- maintainability 

## design process
1. system structuring
    - decomposing system into sub systems
    - block diagrams presenting overview of system structure 
2. control modelling
3. modular decomposition
- terms 
    - subsystem 
    - module

## architectural views
- 4 + 1 view model of architecture
    - logical view
    - development view 
    - process view
    - physical view 
    - (+1) use case

# Architectural patterns 
## model-view-controller pattern
- description 
    - seperates presentation and interaction from system data 
- components
    - view 
        - manages how data is presented 
    - model    
        - manages system data
    - controller 
        - manages user interaction
- used when 
    - there are multiple ways to view and interact with data  
    - future requirments unknown 
- advantages
    - allows data to change intdependently of its representation 
    - supports presentation of data in diffent ways 
- disadvantage 
    - additional code complexity 
## layered architecture 
- descrition
    - organises system into layers with related functionality associated with each layer 
- used when 
    - incrementaly developed 
    - developed across several teams
    - multi level security requirment
- advantages 
    - allows replacement of entire layers
    - redundancy
    - portability
- disadvantages 
    - cleanly seperating layers is difficult
    - interaction limited to the adjacent layer 
    - preformace impact
## repository architecture 
- description
    - central repo accessible to all system components 
    - components do not interact directly
- used when
    - large volumes of info
    - data driven system 
- advantages 
    - independent components
    - active / passive repo 
    - data is consistant
- disadvantages
    - repo = single point of failure
    - may be inneficient communication
    - distributing repo may be difficult 
## client-server architecture
- description
    - functionality organized into services 
    - each service delivered from a seperate server 
- used when
    - shared database must be accessed froma range of services 
    - system load is variable 
- advantages 
    - servers can be distributed 
    - general functionality does not need to be implimented by all services 
- disadvantages
    - each service is a single point of failure 
    - unpredictable preformance 
## pipe and filter architecture 
- description
    - processing of data in a system is organized so that each component is discrete and carries out one type of data transformation 
- used when
    - data processing applications where inputs are processed at seperate stages 
- advantages 
    - easy to undestand and evolve and supports tranformation reuse 
    - workflow matches buisness processes 
    - can be implimentat as sequential or concurrent 
- disadvantages
    - format for data tranfer must be agreed between tranformations
    - each tranformation must parse/unparse its IO
    - may not be possible to reuse tranformations

# distributed systems architectures 
- collection of independant computers that appears to the user as a single system
- characteristics 
    - resource sharing 
    - openness
    - concurrency 
    - scalability
    - fault tolerance 
- issues
    - complex
    - need for middleware
- patterns
    - master-slave architecture
        - central control process controls many slave processes
        - operator consols interact with central process 
    - two teir client-server
        - clients recieve presentation from server
        - data managment done on server
        - database resides on server
        - thin client model 
            - application processing done on server
        - fat client model 
            - application processing done on client 
    - multi tier client server architecture 
        - common on most websites 
        - server/client interaction 
        - data managment done on seperent database 
        - example
            - client: web browser
            - server: web server
            - database: sql server 

## peer to peer architectue
- decentraized 
    - bittorrent, bitcoin, napster
- usage 
    - computationaly intense 
    - independent 
    - no centeral managment of data
- security concerns 
- semi- centralized p2p architecure 
    - all clients associated with discovery server (napster browser)

# control models
- centralized control
    - control subsystem takes responsibility for managing execution of other subsytems
    - call/return model
        - control subsystem calls routines that call routines
    - manager model
        - messages passed back and forth between manager and subsystems
- event driven system
    - driven by external events
    - broadcast models 
        - components listen for specific events
            - when those events happen, control transfers to those subsystems
        - advantages 
            - evolution is simple
            - active without name/location
            - transparent distibution 
        - disadvantages 
            - subsystems dont lnof if/when event will be handled
            - possible component conflicts 
    - interrupt driven models 
        - used in real time systems where fast response is essential 
        - predefined interrupt types wiht a handler defined for each type

# modular decomposition
- subsystems decomposed into modules
- models
    - object model
        - set of loosely coupled objects 
        - object oriented 
            - objects created from classes
            - control model used to coordinate operations
    - data flow model 
        - functional transformation
        - inputs and outputs
        - pipe and filter model 
        - **not suitible for interactive systems**

# application architectures 
- purpose 
    - starting point for architectural design 
    - checklist 
    - oragnising work
    - assessing components for reuse 
    - vocab for talking about types of applications
- architectural models specifict to some domains
- types 
    - generic models
        - abstractions from real systems 
        - E.g. compiler model 
    - reference models 
        - more abstract, idealized model 
        - derived from domain, not exisitng systems
        - basis for system implementation 
        - purpose 
            - evaluate anc compare design proposals 
            - educate people about architctural characterstics in that domain
- application types 
    - data processing applications 
    - trascation processing applications
    - event processing systems 
    - language processing systems
